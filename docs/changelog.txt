	<<<  Change Log. >>>
2020 11.23
        * Mesh.GetElementCenterArray is added, which returns numpy array
2020 11.21
        * cuda build is tested
	* In solver.hpp, many routines takes Operator &, but FormLinearSystem
	  takes OperatorHandle. A new typemap (operator_ptr_typemap) is added to
	  call OperatorHandle -> Ptr() inside the wrapper so that one can pass
	  OperatorHandle to the routines such as SetOperator, PCG and etc.
	  
2020 11.05
        * migration to pip install
	* mesh.GetVertexArray() is added to return the all vertices
	* mesh.Mesh(int, int, "element name") was fixed

2018 09.27
	* strumpack support is added
	* ParFiniteElementSpace:: GetSharedEdgeDofs, ParFiniteElementSpace::GetSharedFaceDofs are wrapped to return list
2018 06.22
	* regenerate wrapper using MFEM 3.4
	* In nonlinearfomr.i, a new typemap is introduce to wrap folloing
	* arguments as list/tuple
	**  Array<FiniteElementSpace *>
	**  Array<Array<int>>
	**  Array<Vector *>
	* following dynamic cast wrapper is added
	** Opr2BlockOpr : Operator -> BlockOprator
	** Opr2SparseMat : Operator -> SparseMatrix
2018 04.18
	* update ex10p
	* CHypreParVec::__mul__, __imul__  are updated to support multiplying
	complex number
	* Various fixes in chypre.py
	* wrapper class regenerated using mfem 324d66b0c7fc75225e830dcfb02647722bae1fe0
	* INSTALL instruction is updated to mention DMFEM_USE_EXCEPTIONS=1
	 
2018 02.12
	* ParMesh::ParMesh(comm, filename)  
	* ParMesh::ParPrintToFile(filename) # convinent version of ParPrint
	* ParGridFunction::ParGridFunction(pmesh, filename)
        ** this is implemented temporariy in a python proxy class
	** it will be changed to call C++ constructor when a new version
	** is released.
	
2018 02.02
	* Vector::Print(filename) and SparseMatrix::Print(filename) are added
	* chypre.IdentityPyMat is added
	* chypre.CHypreVec.GlobalVector was rewritten to do allgather on python level.
2018 01.24
	* The issue of not raising the type conversion error when int is an argument
	is fixed
	* ToHypreParCSR is modified so that it causes hypre_CSRMatrixReorder call when
	col_starts and row_starts are the same.
2018 01.20
	* generating mfem::SparseMatrix from scipy.csr_matrix is added
	* setting mfem::Vector using numpy array is added
	* BlockOperator and BlockMatrix keeps a link to offset and operators
	
2018 01.03
	* fiexed mfem.par.InnerProduct. It was overwriten by InnerProduct defined in Vector
	* EmptySquarePyMat and HStackPyVec are added in chypre.py
	* DeltaCoefficient is not ignored anymore.
	
2017 12.27
        * Overloaded functions whose definitionsare distributed among several .hpp are
	  handled by common_functions.i. Such functions include Add, Mult, Transpose,
	  RAP, and InnerProduct.
	* Due to above change, add_sparse, add_dense has been removed.
	* Element access to DenseTensor object is added.
	* GetDataArray of DenseTensor and DenseMatrix is changed to return a mere
	  memory view of objects' internal data, instead of copy of data
     	
2017 12.03
	* Rebuild all cxx to work with MFEM 3.3.2
	* mesh::GetBdrElementAdjacentElement is wrapped to return two integers	
	
2017 10.10	chypre.py
	* CHypreMat::__add__ and CHypreMat::__sub__ was calling CHypreMat without
 	  specifing col_parts.
