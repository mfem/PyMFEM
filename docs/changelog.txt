2022 03.
        * Added --cuda-arch option to specify the compute cuda archtecture

2022 02.27
        * Added Cuda-build HYPRE support. Cuda is controlled by two setup.py options
	    --with-cuda  :  MFEM_USE_CUDA is on.
	    --with-cuda-hypre :  HYPRE is built with Cuda.
        * mfem::Device is forced to be a singleton in Python layer too. This keeps MemoryManager
	  from being deallocated before other objects are cleaned.
        * bool mfem::is_HYPRE_USING_CUDA() is added to check if HYPRE is build with Cuda
	* make sure that parallel examples calls mfem::Device
	* enabled --parallel option when building extension modules

2022 02.15
        * added %import globals.i in sparsemat.i and common_functions.i. This is needed when
	  MFEM
    
2022 01.xx
        * Generalized multigrid constructor typemap. It now accept not only tuple/list but also
	  Array<bool> Array<Operator *> and Array<Solver *>, like C++ API does.
	* Following are added to return DoFTransformation
	     FiniteElementSpace::GetElementDoFTransformation
             FiniteElementSpace::GetElementVDoFTransformation
             FiniteElementSpace::GetBdrElementDoFTransformation
             FiniteElementSpace::GetBdrElementVDoFTransformation
	 * DenseMatrix constructor using numpy array is added
             >>> x = mfem.DenseMatrix(np.arange(12.).reshape(3,4))
             >>> x.Print()
                 [row +0]
                 +0.000000e+00 +1.000000e+00 +2.000000e+00 +3.000000e+00
                 [row +1]
                 +4.000000e+00 +5.000000e+00 +6.000000e+00 +7.000000e+00
                 [row +2]
                 +8.000000e+00 +9.000000e+00 +1.000000e+01 +1.100000e+01

2021 12.xx
        * Improved array interface. ex: Array<T>::__getitem__ accespt slice to return subarray

	* ex30.py, ex30p.py were added. CoefficientRefiner::SetIntRule accepts tuple/list
	* ex25 is added. It demonstrates how to use numba JIT
	* Fixed IntegrationPonitArray, IntegrationRulePtrArray. They now returns a proper proxy object
	  when accessed using index
	      ex: IntegrationPonitArray[0] -> return IntegrationPoint
                  IntegrationPonitArray[0:3] -> return IntegrationPointArray (this subarray does not own data)
		  d = IntegrationPonitArray.GetData() -> return IntegrationPoint*
		  IntegrationPonitArray((d, num)) -> A constructore borrowing data.
	* Additional Array<T> template instatiation Array<Vector *> Array<FiniteElementSpace *> Array<bool>	  
	* const IntegrationRule *irs[] in gridfunc.hpp, pgridfunc.hpp, complex_fem.hpp, coefficient.hpp
	  are wrapped to accept tuple/list of IntegrationRule (see ex25.py)
	* Warning about old numpy interface (NPY_1_7..... ) is addressed.
	* GridFunction::Assign (renamed verison of operator ==) accept numpy vector
	* ParGridFunction::Assign (renamed verison of operator ==) accept numpy vector

2021 08.06
        * ex27 is added
	* ex26 is added

	  the constructors such as mfem::Mesh(std::stream &)
	* PrintGZ, SaveGZ, etc are added to the methods to save data to file. As
	  the name suggest, they turn on compression internally.

2021 05.11

	  to use Numba JITed python code for mfem function coefficients.

	* Fiexed MixedBilinearForm::AddBdrTraceFaceIntegrator
	
2021 04.30
        * improved std::ostream & wrappring. Methods which takes std::ostream& are
	wrapped so that it accept either
	   1) filename    for saving data to file
	   2) mfem.STDOUT for writing data to stdout
	   3) StringIO    for in-memory data passing
	
2021 02.14

	  two macros for specfing method and overloaded method as deprecated.
2020 11.29
        * bilininteg.i is adjusted so that NonlinearIntegrator is properly recognized
	  as a base class of BilinearIntegrator class. This allows to use SetIntOrder
	  and some others in BilinearIntegrator
2020 11.23
        * Mesh.GetElementCenterArray is added, which returns numpy array
2020 11.21
        * cuda build is tested
	* In solver.hpp, many routines takes Operator &, but FormLinearSystem
	  takes OperatorHandle. A new typemap (operator_ptr_typemap) is added to
	  call OperatorHandle -> Ptr() inside the wrapper so that one can pass
	  OperatorHandle to the routines such as SetOperator, PCG and etc.

	* Element access to DenseTensor object is added.
	* GetDataArray of DenseTensor and DenseMatrix is changed to return a mere
