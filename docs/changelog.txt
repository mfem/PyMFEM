2021 08.08
        * added ex0p, ex20p, ex21p, ex22p  ex24p, ex26p, ex27p, ex28p
	* memory handling of complex_fem for parallel version is fixed.
	
2021 08.06
        * ex27 is added
	* ex26 is added
	* array((int *, size)) and array((double *, size)) is wrapped. This allows
	  for changing the contents of exisint Array<T>
2021 08.04
	* added ex24. This one shows partial assembly and numba coefficient
	
2021 08.03
        * added constraints wrapper
	* added ex28 and a few other serial examples
	* added director to SecondOrderTimeDependentOperator
	* added ex23

2021 08.02
        * Added ex21
	* SwapNodes returns None when mesh object does not have Nodes
	* added socketstream::good wrapper.
	* added complex_fem wrapper
	
2021 07.31
        * preparation for MFEM4.3
	* test_example now compares all output files.
        * Added ex0, ex20, refreshed many examples
	* mesh.AddVertex accept numpy float array, mfem.Vector or list
	* mesh.AddQuad (and other similar routine which
	  accept const *int vi) accept numpy int32 array, mfem.Array<int> or list
	
2021 05.19
        * Fixed std::istream & wrapping not to return the lenght of data. This fixes
	  the constructors such as mfem::Mesh(std::stream &)
	* PrintGZ, SaveGZ, etc are added to the methods to save data to file. As
	  the name suggest, they turn on compression internally.

2021 05.11
        * NumbaFunction, VectorNumbaFunction, and MatrixNumbaFunction is added
	  to use Numba JITed python code for mfem function coefficients.

2021 05.07
        * vtk.py and datacollection.py was loaded in mfem.ser and mfem.par namespace properly
	* istream& wrapping was improved in the same way as ostream&
	* mfem-4.2 does not have Save(const char*, precision) yet. Added it in wrapper code.
	* Fiexed MixedBilinearForm::AddBdrTraceFaceIntegrator
	
2021 04.30
        * improved std::ostream & wrappring. Methods which takes std::ostream& are
	wrapped so that it accept either
	   1) filename    for saving data to file
	   2) mfem.STDOUT for writing data to stdout
	   3) StringIO    for in-memory data passing
	
2021 02.14
        * WriteToStram is added to mfem::Mesh, mfem::Vector and mfem::GrigFunction

2021 02.07
        * A new Github action to automate PyPI binary release
	
2021 01.17
        * mesh.CartasianPartitioing is improved to accept an iterable (list/tuple)
	  as an argument.
2020 12.06
        * common/depelicated.i is added. This interface file contains
	  two macros for specfing method and overloaded method as deprecated.
2020 11.29
        * bilininteg.i is adjusted so that NonlinearIntegrator is properly recognized
	  as a base class of BilinearIntegrator class. This allows to use SetIntOrder
	  and some others in BilinearIntegrator
2020 11.23
        * Mesh.GetElementCenterArray is added, which returns numpy array
2020 11.21
        * cuda build is tested
	* In solver.hpp, many routines takes Operator &, but FormLinearSystem
	  takes OperatorHandle. A new typemap (operator_ptr_typemap) is added to
	  call OperatorHandle -> Ptr() inside the wrapper so that one can pass
	  OperatorHandle to the routines such as SetOperator, PCG and etc.
	  
2020 11.05
        * migration to pip install
	* mesh.GetVertexArray() is added to return the all vertices
	* mesh.Mesh(int, int, "element name") was fixed

2018 09.27
	* strumpack support is added
	* ParFiniteElementSpace:: GetSharedEdgeDofs, ParFiniteElementSpace::GetSharedFaceDofs are wrapped to return list
2018 06.22
	* regenerate wrapper using MFEM 3.4
	* In nonlinearfomr.i, a new typemap is introduce to wrap folloing
	* arguments as list/tuple
	**  Array<FiniteElementSpace *>
	**  Array<Array<int>>
	**  Array<Vector *>
	* following dynamic cast wrapper is added
	** Opr2BlockOpr : Operator -> BlockOprator
	** Opr2SparseMat : Operator -> SparseMatrix
2018 04.18
	* update ex10p
	* CHypreParVec::__mul__, __imul__  are updated to support multiplying
	complex number
	* Various fixes in chypre.py
	* wrapper class regenerated using mfem 324d66b0c7fc75225e830dcfb02647722bae1fe0
	* INSTALL instruction is updated to mention DMFEM_USE_EXCEPTIONS=1
	 
2018 02.12
	* ParMesh::ParMesh(comm, filename)  
	* ParMesh::ParPrintToFile(filename) # convinent version of ParPrint
	* ParGridFunction::ParGridFunction(pmesh, filename)
        ** this is implemented temporariy in a python proxy class
	** it will be changed to call C++ constructor when a new version
	** is released.
	
2018 02.02
	* Vector::Print(filename) and SparseMatrix::Print(filename) are added
	* chypre.IdentityPyMat is added
	* chypre.CHypreVec.GlobalVector was rewritten to do allgather on python level.
2018 01.24
	* The issue of not raising the type conversion error when int is an argument
	is fixed
	* ToHypreParCSR is modified so that it causes hypre_CSRMatrixReorder call when
	col_starts and row_starts are the same.
2018 01.20
	* generating mfem::SparseMatrix from scipy.csr_matrix is added
	* setting mfem::Vector using numpy array is added
	* BlockOperator and BlockMatrix keeps a link to offset and operators
	
2018 01.03
	* fiexed mfem.par.InnerProduct. It was overwriten by InnerProduct defined in Vector
	* EmptySquarePyMat and HStackPyVec are added in chypre.py
	* DeltaCoefficient is not ignored anymore.
	
2017 12.27
        * Overloaded functions whose definitionsare distributed among several .hpp are
	  handled by common_functions.i. Such functions include Add, Mult, Transpose,
	  RAP, and InnerProduct.
	* Due to above change, add_sparse, add_dense has been removed.
	* Element access to DenseTensor object is added.
	* GetDataArray of DenseTensor and DenseMatrix is changed to return a mere
	  memory view of objects' internal data, instead of copy of data
     	
2017 12.03
	* Rebuild all cxx to work with MFEM 3.3.2
	* mesh::GetBdrElementAdjacentElement is wrapped to return two integers	
	
2017 10.10	chypre.py
	* CHypreMat::__add__ and CHypreMat::__sub__ was calling CHypreMat without
 	  specifing col_parts.
